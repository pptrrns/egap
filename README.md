# EGAP’s Learning Days

The EGAP’s Learning Days workshops provide a comprehensive learning experience that includes design clinics, research presentations, hands-on experience with statistical analysis software, and topical lectures. The sessions covered topics such as randomization, causal inference, hypothesis testing, and impact evaluation.

This 5-day intensive workshop aims to introduce and develop familiarity with causal inference in impact evaluations with a quantitative focus. It is intended for Latin America-based scholars, researchers and practitioners working in academic, non-governmental, and government organizations who carry out analyses related to governance, policy, and development issues.
