## Question 1
- **Inquiry**: We seek to examine the claim that development interventions are most effective when multiple sectors are addressed at the same time.  
- **Data (Assignment)**: We identify 200 villages and select 100 for a combination of interventions that includes both health and educational projects.  
- **Data (Measurement)**: We gather outcome measures on health, education and income. 
- **Analysis**: We estimate effects using simple differences in means between outcomes for children in treatment and control villages.  
- **Assumptions**: We assume no spillovers.


## Question 2
- **Inquiry:** We seek to assess the welfare gains of a community-driven development program in which communities can choose whether to implement education or health programs. 
- **Data (Assignment):** We randomly select 200 out of 400 villages.  In selected villages, development committees can choose projects in either education or health. 
- **Data (Measurement):** We survey 5 subjects in each village and gather data on education and health outcomes. 
- **Analysis:** We estimate effects of health interventions by comparing health outcomes in all treatment areas where communities chose health with control areas. We estimate effects of education interventions by comparing education outcomes in all treatment areas where communities chose education with control areas.  

## Question 3
- **Inquiry:**  We are interested in whether agricultural extension
workers lead to increases in productivity.
- **Data (Assignment):**  200 of 400 villages are randomly selected
to receive visits from agricultural extension workers in post
conflict Congo. Once the treatment villages are identified the
extension workers assess whether any villages are too difficult
to visit. If so, the treatment is not implemented in these areas.
- **Data (Measurement):** Outcome data is gathered in the all
villages using satellite imagery.
- **Analysis:** Treatment effects are measured using simple
differences in means of village average productivity comparing
villages that extension workers visited to those that they did
not.

## Question 4
You are asked to advise an NGO on an impact evaluation design. The NGO has enough resources to implement a cash transfer program in 60 farmers and would like to know the impact of the program. A colleague did a power analysis based on a recent survey in a similar area and produced the table below.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{r c c c c}
\hline\hline
&                     & Mean    & SD    &  MDE  \\ \hline
& Farm yield          & 0.35    & 0.70  & 0.36 \\
& Expenses on Mezcal  & 200     & 200   & 103 \\
& Income              & 600     & 2400  & 1237  \\
\hline\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

a. Is the study adequately powered to detect an effect of 0.2 SD in farm yield?
b. Does this represents a type 1 error - false positive or type 2 error - false negative
c. What would you do which would increase statistical power in the following design?

## Question 5

- What is the definition of a p-value

## Question 6

- What do we want from a good hypothesis test?

## Question 7

## Question 8

## Question 8
- What is the estimand?
- What is the estimator?
- How large is the treatment effect?
- What is the vaccination rate on control villages?
- What is the sample size?
