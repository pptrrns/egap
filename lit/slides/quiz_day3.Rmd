## Question 1

I am conducting a study and need to send an informational email to exactly 100 participants,
with the rest (the other 100) receiving a control email. The only information I have about these participants is
their email addresses. Should I randomize using simple, complete, blocked, and clustered random assignment?

## Question 2

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{r c c c c}
\hline\hline
&         &     & Cash &   \\ \hline
&          &    & $X_1=0, no cash$ & $X_1=1, cash$ \\
& Information  & $X_2=0, Placebo$ & A  & C \\
&              & $X_2=1, Information$ & B  & D  \\
\hline\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}


I have the following factorial design. I want know what is the effect of:

1. Getting cash and information vs neither;
2. The effect of cash vs no cash;
3. Among people who didnâ€™t get cash, the effect of getting the information vs not

For each, what comparisons should I make between A B C and D?

## Question 3

Compare two experiments, one of which uses block random assignment and one of which uses cluster random assignment.
Which one is which?

a. In a district with 100 villages each with 100 people in them, I randomly assign 50 people per village to treatment and 50 to control.

b. I randomly assign 100 people per village to treatment and 0 to control or 100 people per village to control and 0 to treatment.

## Question 4

Spillovers are a type of threat to internal validity of an experiment. Does this refer to:

a. The effect of participating in an experiment on others who are
not participating in the experiment
b. The effect of a treatment on those in another treatment arm in
the experiment
c. The effect of a treatment on participants in another experiment
d. The effect of a treatment on participants when they have left
the experiment

## Question 5

A researcher uses randomizr to assign treatment to half of the sample. Using some baseline demographic data she then assesses whether the randomization resulted in a balanced sample. She finds that the sample is not balanced on gender and decides to re-randomize treatment until all covariates are balanced.

- What is your response to this practice?
