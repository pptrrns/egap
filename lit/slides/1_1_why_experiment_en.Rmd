## Key points for this lecture *

- What is a policy experiment?

- Who uses experiments?

- What are experiments good for (and not)?


## Policy experiments

A method for: \medskip

- Putting beliefs about what works to the test 
- Enabling policy decisions based on data


## What is an experiment?  

- Question: does engaging commmunities with service providers increase utilisation and health outcomes
- Why we care: accountability of service providers to end users
- Idea: if communities know what they should expect from clinics and can action on this information they can hold nurses to account and increase outcomes (like absenteeism, service, information, etc)

## What is an experiment?  

- Research partner: Three NGOs and MoH in Sierra Leone
- Intervention: community monitoring program
- Experimental design: 2 year program randomly assigned to clinics 

- Outcome: clinic utilisation, satisfaction, health outcomes
- Results: more people coming to clinics, more satisfied and lower U5M
- And more likely to get rested during Ebola crisis

## Why an experiment?

Random assignment $\rightarrow$ highly credible evidence that the change to messages at rallies led to a change in vote share \bigskip

If politicians believe results $\rightarrow$ decide to change campaigns


## Long history of the method 

- Late 1700s, early 1800s: early double-blind experiments with comparison group (not randomized) 
- 1920s: first randomized experiments in agriculture, education, and political science
- 1965: first clinical randomized trial (Streptomycin for TB)
- 2019: Nobel prize for popularizing randomized experiments in economics (Banerjee, Duflo, Kremer)


## Widespread use  

- Clinical trials required by regulators for vaccines, medicines, and treatments 
- Political campaigns test mobilization and persuasion strategies 
- Economic policies to combat poverty
- Tech companies test website features to find most lucrative ("lean startup") 
- Governments test policies in "nudge units"


## Use in social science

Despite recent introduction in social science, big impacts already \bigskip 

- Proved long-held beliefs wrong
- Demonstrated practices that work in US don't work in Global South
- Proved new ideas right

## Use in social science

Despite recent introduction in social science, big impacts already \bigskip 

- Led to scaling up good policies
- Led to discovery that policies do not scale well

## Proving beliefs wrong I

- Belief: local democratic institutions improve delivery of development aid (CDD)
- Partner: International Rescue Committee, CARE
- Intervention: two years of democratic institutions and development program

## Proving beliefs wrong I

- Experimental design: randomly assign village clusters to treatment or not
- Outcomes: corruption, government practices chosen after intervention
- Result: no change (well, at least in the short run)

## Proving beliefs wrong II

- Belief: engagement between police & citizens improves trust, lowers crime
- Partner: Police agencies in six countries 
- Intervention: "community policing" (townhalls, beat patrols, etc.)
- Experimental design: randomly assign police beats to receive/not 
- Outcomes: citizen trust in and cooperation with police, crime
- Result: no change in any main outcome

## Proving beliefs right 

- Belief: conditional cash transfers change behavior, improve welfare
- Implementing agency: Mexico public health ministry
- Intervention: cash to mothers conditioned on children attending school, going to health clinics (Progresa)
- Experimental design: first phase of rollout randomly assigned to communities
- Outcomes: poverty, school attendance, health
- Result: improvements in every outcome

## Proving beliefs right 

Incomplete list of places with CCTs following the Progresa study:\bigskip

Argentina, Bangladesh, Brazil, Cambodia, Chile, Colombia, Egypt, Guatemala, Honduras, Indonesia, Jamaica, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Peru, Philippines, Turkey, US


## Scaling up successes 

- Belief: deworming medication affects only patient's health
- Intervention: deworm all children in a community at once
- Experimental design: randomly assign communities to receive/not mass deworming
- Outcomes: health, but also school attendance
- Results: effects much larger than believed; cost effective way to improve school attendance, health, even after 20 years

## Limitations to experiments 

Some questions don't need an experiment\medskip

- Does smoking cause poor health?
- Do parachutes help when you jump out of a plane? \medskip

## Limitations to experiments 

Some questions shouldn't have an experiment \medskip 

- Does changing the interest rate affect inflation? 
- What is the poverty rate? \medskip

Important role for descriptive research, qualitative investigation



## Why experiments 

Put beliefs about effects of policies to the test \bigskip

What policies works? \smallskip

$\rightarrow$ let's find out
