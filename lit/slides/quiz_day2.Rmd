## Question 1

Question 1: What is an individual causal effect (individual treatment effect)?

## Question 2 

Question 2: What is the fundamental problem of causal inference?

## Question 3

Question 3: Can we learn the true average treatment effect?

## Question 4

Which of the core assumptions for causal inference are more likely to be violated in this scenario?
\medskip
A researcher wants to learn the effect of a campaign against vaccine hesitancy on vaccine uptake. The researcher proposes to make a list of all adults in a village and randomly select 50% to visit with the campaign, then come back 2 months later and compare vaccine uptake rate for the two groups.

Which of the core assumptions for causal inference are violated in this scenario?. . .

- Random assignment of treatment
- SUTVA (non-interference)
- Excludability

## Question 5

A researcher has partnered with the Ministry of Agriculture and they
have collected data from a random sample of farmers. The survey
asked two main questions. (1) Have you made use of extension
services in the last year? (2) What was your yield per hectare in the
last two years? The researcher finds that the yield is twice as high
for those who used extension services than for those who did not.
He tells the Ministry that extension services increase yields and that
they should scale up the extension services to all farmers.
\medskip

- Is the researcherâ€™s recommendation supported by this analysis?


## Question 6

Which of the following is an instance of random assignment?

a. The DHS survey randomly selects 5 individuals per village to participate in their survey.
b. Higher-than-average rainfall haphazardly washes out some roads but not others.
c. Medical researchers randomly allocate 15 patients with a rare disease to a new treatment and 15
patients with the same disease to receive a placebo.
d. In advance of an election, polling firms randomly select phone numbers to ask potential voters whether
they plan to vote or not.

## Question 7

Consider these:

- Mezcal tastes great
- Drinking Mezcal increases your happiness
- Drinking Mezcal either increases, decreases, or has no effect on your happiness
- Drinking Mezcal is good for you because it strengthens your character in very fundamental ways that you could never measure

Now:
a. Just one of these is not a hypothesis. Which one?
b. Just one of these is a good hypothesis. Which one?
